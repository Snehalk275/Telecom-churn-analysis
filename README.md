# Telecom Customer Churn Analysis

This project focuses on analyzing customer churn patterns in a telecom company using SQL, Python, and Power BI.

## Objective
The goal of this analysis is to identify key factors contributing to customer churn and highlight high-risk customer segments to support data-driven retention strategies.

## Tools & Technologies
- SQL (MySQL) – data querying and segmentation
- Python (Pandas, Matplotlib) – data cleaning and exploratory data analysis
- Power BI – interactive dashboard and visualization

## Key Analysis Areas
- Overall customer churn rate
- Churn distribution across contract types
- Impact of tenure on churn
- Monthly charges comparison between churned and active customers
- Payment method influence on churn

## Dashboard Overview
The Power BI dashboard provides:
- Key KPIs such as total customers, churned customers, and churn rate
- Visual analysis of churn by contract, tenure, and payment method
- Filters for interactive exploration

## Key Insights
- Customers on month-to-month contracts have the highest churn rate
- Churn is concentrated among customers with shorter tenure
- Higher monthly charges are associated with increased churn risk
